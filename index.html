The NoiseTor Project:

<ol><li>Donate money to Noisebridge
<li>Noisebridge sets up Tor nodes
<li>The internet is a more free place

Noisebridge has joined forces with the Tor Project and the EFF to create a program where people can donate to a US-based non-profit organization and directly see their donations turn into Tor nodes.
